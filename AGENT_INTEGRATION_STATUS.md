# Agent Integration Status - UPDATED

## Current State: ‚úÖ WORKING (Fallback Mode)

### What's Happening

The system uses a robust fallback mechanism:

```
1. Attempts: InMemoryRunner(agent=root_agent).run(...)
2. If fails: Falls back to direct tool calls (Gemini + Document AI)
3. Result: 90.81% ANLS on 100 samples ‚úÖ
```

**The 90.81% ANLS results come from the FALLBACK path, which works reliably.**

---

## Test Results

### InMemoryRunner Test (v1 approach)
```bash
‚ùå InMemoryRunner does not work reliably
ValueError: Session not found: [session_id]
```

### V2 Evaluator with Fallback (October 23, 2025)
```bash
‚úÖ 3 samples: 100% ANLS (perfect)
‚úÖ 10 samples: 86.97% ANLS (good)
‚úÖ 100 samples: 90.81% ANLS (excellent)
```

## The Problem

### ADK InMemoryRunner Issues

1. **Session Management:** Runner can't find sessions it just created
2. **Async/Sync Conflict:** Threading issues between async runner and sync code
3. **Library Limitation:** This appears to be a bug/limitation in ADK 1.16.0

### Current Workaround

The evaluation bypasses the agent entirely:
- ‚úÖ Calls `process_document_with_ocr()` directly
- ‚úÖ Calls `GenerativeModel.generate_content()` directly
- ‚úÖ No agent orchestration

**This works for single-agent, but blocks multi-agent architecture.**

---

## Impact on Multi-Agent Plans

### ‚úÖ **CAN Proceed with Multi-Agent System**

**Current Approach: Use the Working Fallback Mode**

The fallback mode (direct tool calls) can be extended to support multi-agent architecture:

```python
# Single-agent (current)
result = call_gemini_with_ocr(question, image, ocr_text)

# Multi-agent (future)
if is_table_question:
    result = table_specialist_agent(question, image, ocr_text)
elif is_image_question:
    result = vision_specialist_agent(question, image)
else:
    result = orchestrator_decides(question, image, ocr_text)
```

**This is actually MORE flexible than trying to force ADK InMemoryRunner to work!**

---

## Options for Multi-Agent Development

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Direct Multi-Agent Implementation (RECOMMENDED)
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Status:** Ready to start NOW

Build multi-agent system using direct tool calls (same approach as current fallback):

```python
# agents/vision_specialist.py
class VisionSpecialist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash-exp")
    
    def answer(self, image, question):
        # Specialized prompt for visual questions
        return self.model.generate_content([image, question])

# agents/orchestrator.py
class Orchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vision_specialist = VisionSpecialist()
        self.ocr_specialist = OCRSpecialist()
    
    def route(self, question, image):
        if is_visual_question(question):
            return self.vision_specialist.answer(image, question)
        else:
            return self.ocr_specialist.answer(image, question)
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works immediately (uses proven fallback approach)
- ‚úÖ No ADK limitations
- ‚úÖ Full control over agent logic
- ‚úÖ Can achieve 93-95% ANLS target
- ‚úÖ Simple to test and debug

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not "true" ADK agents (but does it matter if it works better?)

---

### Option 2: ADK REST API Integration
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard  
**Timeline:** 3-5 days  
**Status:** Partially implemented, needs API endpoint discovery

Use `adk web` server with REST API:
- ‚úÖ Code written (`tools/agent_client.py`, `evaluation/docvqa_evaluator_v2.py`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to discover correct API endpoints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires running server process

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ "Official" ADK approach
- ‚úÖ Better for production deployment

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HTTP overhead
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still investigating correct API format

---

### Option 3: Fix InMemoryRunner
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Timeline:** Unknown (could be days or impossible)  
**Status:** Not recommended

Try to fix the InMemoryRunner session management bug.

**Recommendation: Skip this.** It's a library limitation and not worth the time when Option 1 works perfectly.

---

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

**Decision: Use Option 1 (Direct Multi-Agent Implementation)**

This lets you start multi-agent development **immediately** with the proven approach:

1. ‚úÖ **Push current code to GitHub** (90.81% baseline established)
2. ‚úÖ **V2 evaluator working** (fallback mode tested and verified)
3. üöß **Start multi-agent development** using direct tool calls:

```python
# Week 1: Create specialist agents
agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vision_specialist.py      # For image/photo questions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ocr_specialist.py         # For table/form questions  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.py           # Routes to specialists
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ answer_validator.py       # Validates responses

# Week 2-3: Integrate and test
- Build routing logic
- Test on 10 samples
- Compare to single-agent baseline

# Week 3-4: Full evaluation
- Run 100+ sample benchmark
- Target: 93-95% ANLS
```

### Why This Approach?

‚úÖ **Pragmatic:** Uses what works (fallback mode = 90.81% ANLS)  
‚úÖ **Fast:** Start building multi-agent TODAY  
‚úÖ **Flexible:** Full control over agent logic  
‚úÖ **Proven:** Same approach that achieved 90.81%  
‚úÖ **Testable:** Easy to debug and iterate  

### ADK Integration: Future Work

Once multi-agent system works:
- Can revisit ADK REST API integration
- Can compare performance
- Can decide if ADK adds value

**But don't let ADK limitations block multi-agent development!**
